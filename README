# This project aims to optimize the expansion strategy of FreeToX, a leading EV charging operator in Italy, by applying big data analytics and machine learning.

Conducted within the LUISS x FreeToX collaboration, the project is structured into three core tasks:
Task 1: Data Cleaning, Integration & Network Insights
We processed and integrated multiple datasets—including charging sessions, station metadata, and geographic records—to build a unified view of the FreeToX network. This enabled early insights into installation patterns, energy consumption, and regional distribution trends.

Task 2: Site Scoring & Throughput Forecasting
Leveraging external data sources (traffic, population density, POIs, eco-incentives), we developed a forecasting framework to estimate charging throughput and evaluate site potential. This allowed us to identify strategic, high-impact locations for future installations.

Task 3: Modeling & Ranking Optimal Locations
We trained and compared machine learning models to predict station-level performance and economic viability. Locations were ranked using a composite scoring index based on usage data, revenue per kWh, cost metrics, amenity richness, and competitor presence.

Tools & Technologies

**Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, PySpark, GeoPandas, Folium, Osmnx
**Data Sources**: CDRs, PDRs, Hypercharge Sessions/Locations, TGMA, ISTAT, GeoJSON
**Modeling Techniques**: Regression models, entropy measures, location scoring, KPI-based ranking

Objective
The project delivers data-driven recommendations to support FreeToX in strategically expanding its EV charging infrastructure—minimizing deployment risk and maximizing network efficiency, usage, and profitability.
